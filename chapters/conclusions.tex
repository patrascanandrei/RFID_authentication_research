The use of temporary variables needs to be done with great care, especially when the desired 
properties for a specific application are both security and privacy. The need for them arose
from achieving authentication, however for different classes of tags and their associated capabilities
different classes of adversaries are linked and thus different potential achievable privacy.
The specific application in which tags are used derive also the need for specific security properties
and for the case of privacy the restrictions of tags have a primary role.
