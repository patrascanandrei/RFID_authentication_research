The choice towards studying RFID schemes and their security came for multiple reasons. 

Firstly the applications for this fascinating technology are vast, they provide near-instant authentication for multiple tags 
at the same time meaning it can be used in the medical field, for supply chains, in the automotive and construction industry and where 
it all started, in a military context. They provide access control from authentication of staff to providing access to ski lifts.

Secondly a typical RFID scheme is an environment where achieving security properties is difficult. The tags come with multiple 
constraints like processing power and limited memory and some of them can only work only when interacting with a reader. This means 
that the RFID protocols need to strike a balance between lightness of operations and a solid security parameter. 
The tags are also cheap devices that are not temperproof, meaning new difficulties in developing solid protocols concerning how
memory is used.

All these limitations and the possible applications of RFID schemes lead to a challenging but rewarding 
field of study.
