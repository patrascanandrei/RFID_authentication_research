        In a world that grows more and more a reliability on smart devices the need for secure and private protocols grows with it. One such technology that makes 
    this possible is RFID(Radio Frequency Identification).

        During World-War II, the British wanted to distinguish between enemy and their own returning aircraft. To achieve this they placed transponders
    on their aircrafts which would respond to queries from the base stations. This was called the Identity Friend or Foe(IFF) system, which is considered to be the
    first use of RFID.

        Since then RFID technology has been applied to a number of technical and scientific fields. In medicine RFID tags are used in blood transfusion and analysis. 
    A RFID reader scans the tags attached to blood bags and finds the appropriate one for a specific patient. In the aeronautics industry, RFID tags are used for the
    supply chain. In the automotive industry, the tags can be attached to parts of a car and tracked during assembly. RFID also has many applications in the 
    construction industry \cite{Domdouzis}, from automated tracking of pipe spools to tracking the location of buried assets.
